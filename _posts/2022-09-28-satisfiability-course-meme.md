I loved the Automated Reasoning: Satisfiability course by Professor Hans Zantema from TU Eindhoven on Coursera. While he was explaining boolean multipliction using SAT solvers I burst out laughing as he pronounced **'fac'** short for factorise as **'f\*\*k'**.

Jokes apart, I loved this course and would 100% recommend others to take it. Somewhat dissapointed I didn't complete this course before starting the Slitherlink project so I wouldn't have spent hours trying to come up with this algorithm.

```python
def nTrue(vars,n):
    return list(map(lambda x:list(x),list(combinations([-i for i in vars],n+1))))+list(map(lambda x:list(x),list(combinations(vars,len(vars)+1-n))))
```

 If only I had moved on to the third week and learnt about converting formulas to CNF before. ðŸ˜­
