### Who is the author of this blog?

The original name for this blog was going to simbakhera.com since GoDaddy conveniently purchased siddkhera.com just a few weeks after I searched for it. Simba is my canine sibling, and he I can assure you, he is not writing this blog. The person writing this blog is Siddhanth Khera. Most people call me Khera, but if you find it hard to pronounce the voiceless velar fricative 'x' (j in j√°rdin or ch in acht) feel free to call me Sidd.

I am a student from The Shri Ram School, Aravali in grade 12 (=HS Senior) and will be graduating in the May of 2023.
